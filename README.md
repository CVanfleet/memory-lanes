# Overview

The purpose for the app/project was to allow the user to add in special events on the ArcGIS map api. This would help them keep track of special events in their lives!

I plan on improving this later on, I will probably use a more useful framework like Angular or something similar. I would also love to write this in Kotlin so we can get this on mobile devices as well!

# Development Environment

I ended up using the server Live-Server with Visual Studio Code (this is why I was having so many issues, because live-server does not do great with HTTP requests)

This was written in HTML/CSS/JS with a JSON file to sync data

# Useful Websites

* [ArcGIS](https://developers.arcgis.com/documentation/mapping-apis-and-services/tutorials/)

# Future Work

* Change design to include a database
* Fix functionality
* Add in new data field (e.g. eventDate, and images!)
