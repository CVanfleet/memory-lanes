# Overview

The purpose for the app/project was to allow the user to add in special events on the ArcGIS map api. This would help them keep track of special events in their lives!

I plan on improving this later on, I will probably use a more useful framework like Angular or something similar. I would also love to write this in Kotlin so we can get this on mobile devices as well!
